#Repository Description:
This repository contains a collection of small projects focusing on file handling and data storage developed by me.

Hotel Bill Generation System:
The "Hotel Bill Generation System" is a console-based application that automates the process of generating bills for hotel customers. It allows the user to enter details of a customer's stay, including room charges, food and beverage expenses, additional services, and discounts. The system then calculates the total bill amount and generates a detailed bill receipt for the customer.

Student Details Store:
The "Student Details Store" project is a simple desktop application built using file handling techniques to store and manage student information. Users can add, modify, and delete student records, including details like name, age, address, and contact information. The application saves the student data to a text file, making it easy to access and update the records.
These projects were developed using VB.NET and aim to demonstrate foundational concepts of file handling and data storage in practical scenarios. Each project is well-documented with comments for better understanding and readability.
